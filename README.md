# AI_Image_Gen

Website to create an image on CPU (GPU recommended)

This repository provides a simple website / Jupyter-based project to generate images using multiple Stable Diffusion style models. The project was developed to work on CPU (for accessibility/testing) but will be significantly faster on a GPU — GPU usage is recommended for practical generation times.

What I did and what's next
I created the core model list and integrated local persistence so every generated image, its prompt, and the generation time are stored in a single SQLite database file (`ai_images`). I also tracked model download entries in the same DB. My next steps are to improve performance (GPU support/optimization), add more automated tests and examples, and refine the web UI for better UX.

Features
- Six image-generation model configurations included (various size/speed/quality profiles)
- Every generated image (binary/filename), prompt text, generation timestamp, and model used is stored in an `ai_images` SQLite database file
- Tracks model downloads in the DB
- Designed to run on CPU but recommends GPU for speed and quality

Repository
- Owner / repo: Shashankkusu/AI_Image_Gen
- Languages: Jupyter Notebook (primary), Python

Quick start (local, CPU)
1. Clone the repo
   - git clone https://github.com/Shashankkusu/AI_Image_Gen.git
2. Switch to the project directory
   - cd AI_Image_Gen
3. Install dependencies
   - Recommended: create a virtualenv first
   - pip install -r requirements.txt
   - (If there is no requirements.txt, install commonly used libs: `pip install torch torchvision transformers diffusers accelerate pillow jupyterlab sqlite3` — note `sqlite3` may be bundled with Python.)
4. Run from Jupyter Notebook
   - jupyter lab  (or jupyter notebook) and open the provided notebooks
5. Or run app script (if present)
   - python app.py
   - The web interface (if implemented) will start and allow prompt-based generation.

Using the MODELS dictionary
- The MODELS mapping in the code contains keys (tiny, small, dreamshaper, openjourney, mini-sd, portrait).
- To add a model: update the MODELS dict with a new key and required attributes (`name`, `size`, `speed`, `quality`, `resolution`, `type`).
- Example:
  MODELS["my-model"] = {
    "name": "organization/model-name",
    "size": "3GB",
    "speed": "Medium",
    "quality": "Very Good",
    "resolution": 512,
    "type": "stable_diffusion"
  }

Database: ai_images (SQLite)
All generated images, prompts, generation times, and model download metadata are stored in an SQLite file named `ai_images`. The DB contains three tables:

1) generated_images
- Stores each generated image metadata (filename or blob), prompt, model used, and timestamp.

2) model_downloads
- Tracks downloads (or loads) of model files, useful for debugging and telemetry.

3) sqllite_sequence
- Standard SQLite sequence table used for AUTOINCREMENT bookkeeping (created automatically by SQLite).

Example usage flow
1. User selects a model (e.g., "small") and a resolution and enters a prompt.
2. The backend enqueues or directly runs the generation with the corresponding model parameters.
3. When generation completes, the resulting image is saved to disk (e.g. ./outputs/) and metadata is inserted into `generated_images`.
4. The UI shows the generated image and provides options to download or regenerate.

Performance notes
- CPU: works for experimentation but generation will be slow, especially for the larger models (several minutes per image depending on CPU and resolution).
- GPU: strongly recommended. If you have an NVIDIA GPU and proper CUDA drivers, install the appropriate `torch` build with CUDA and enable GPU generation.
- Memory/disk: some models are multiple GBs — ensure enough disk space and memory for model loading.

Troubleshooting tips
- "Out of memory" errors: reduce resolution, switch to a smaller model (tiny/mini-sd), or use a machine with more RAM/GPU memory.
- Slow CPU generation: reduce steps or batch size, or run on GPU.
- Missing dependencies: double-check the Python environment and installed packages.

Contributing
- Contributions welcome. Please open issues or pull requests. If you add models, please include source, size, and expected resolution in the MODELS dict.
